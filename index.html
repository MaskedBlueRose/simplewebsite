                <p class="p1">Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia that can be used to research a variety of topics.
                    The site holds countless topics that are available to be researched.
                    The information on the site is written collaboratively by a dedicateed community.
                    Articles on the site are regularly monitoted in order to correct any mistakes an editor may have made or any edits a bad actor may have made.</p>
                <p class="p2"> I'm pretty sure everyone knows what Wikipedia is but still, it is very useful to gather quick information about a topic.
                    Although it is great for gathering information, I still go and find reliable sources if I the information is for some kind of assignment.
                    Most of the time, the information is accurate, but since anyone can edit it and the fact that it is not a primary source, I can't use it as a source.
                    Even if it can't be used as a source, it is still very useful for finding information on very obscure topics.
